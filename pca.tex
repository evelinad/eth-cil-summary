\section{Intrinsic Dimensionality}
The goal is to find the ``information-preserving''/``interesting'' dimensions. Usually we have a high-dimensional space (let it be of dimension \(M\)) and try to project it to a low-dimensional space (i.e. to a dimension \(N\) such that \(0 \leq N \leq M\)) without loosing ``too much'' of the information (with regard to a loss function). This can be used for example for data compression, feature selection or complexity reduction (``noise removal'').
